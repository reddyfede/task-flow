# TaskFlow

TaskFlow is an app to manage your team work.
The Team Leader can create tasks and assign them to team members on a week-calendar.
Team Members can view tasks assigned to them on a day-calendar and interact with tasks logging:

- task start time
- task pause start/end time
- encountered issue start and end time
- task end time

The calendar will automatically shifts all the tasks assigned to a Team Member if one task is taking more (or less) time to complete compared to the estimate of the Team Leader.
